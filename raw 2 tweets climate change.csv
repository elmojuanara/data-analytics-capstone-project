15304,@AJemaineClement @SenTedCruz The Paris Climate Agreement has nothing to do with the citizens of Paris apart from the fact that they also share Global Climate. It's just where it was originally negotiated by the UN. @SenTedCruz is a lunatic.
15305,"@SenTedCruz 🤣🤣🤣 You're stupid! That's not what Paris climate agreement is about. If we get the jump on it. It's our technologies that can bring in

15310,"@SenTedCruz Citizens of Paris?? It's called the Paris Climate Agreement because it was signed in Paris, dumbass. And every couple try that can make a different has signed it. It's 2021."
15311,@globaltimesnews And this is how biden is back in Paris climate agreement.
15312,"@SenTedCruz The Paris Climate Agreement is so named because that is where it was SIGNED.
It is not an agreement between the US and the city.
Oh BTW  it's Paris France not Paris TX.
Is this guy Cruz really up to it? Seems a bit ignorant to me."
15313,A quick google search can easily tell you that the Paris Climate Agreement has nothing to do with “citizens of Paris”. We need to stop the spread of fake news! https://t.co/g81rOwxiAP

15316,@SenTedCruz Wait.  Does Ted Cruz actually believe the Paris Climate Agreement only references the local climate of the City of Paris????  Congress needs members with at least a reasonable level of education and/or plain common sense.  Texas deserves better representation.
15317,Hats of to Biden for returning the USA back into the Paris climate agreement
15318,@AOC The Paris climate agreement is a joke. It will never have even a fraction of one degree affect on our climate. It will just cost us all a lot of money. Do some actual unbiased research on climate in stead of grandstanding.

15328,@SenTedCruz So I'm not saying Biden does or does not care about the views of Parisian people. I'm just saying that rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement has like literally nothing to do with that and that it's embarrassing for you to say that.

15353,"@Sethrogen A small detail, but very telling... he talks about people who work in ""energy"" but means fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas, etc). He definitely doesn't mean clean energy, an industry poised for a huge boom, and only aided by the Paris Climate Agreement and the Green New Deal."

21743,Biden plans to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and I am all in for it. Global warming is an issue for the whole world and we must prevent it from happening for the future generations. I’m so stoked for Biden to officially become president tomorrow.
21744,"HEY! TOMORROW WE'RE REJOINING THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT!!!!! 🍻🥂

...noone's talking about that! 

PASS IT ON!"

21752,"Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement Is the Easy Part – Mother Jones The hard part is finding a VERY LARGE jar of Vaseline for our nation so it will hurt less as the megalomaniac’s, marxist’s and failed third world countries stick it to us!! https://t.co/BL8PiRdiEk"
21753,Biden is rejoining the Paris climate agreement. That's the easy part. https://t.co/We1YdtwARn
21754,"@ayanaeliza Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement on Day 1!!!!!!  So critical for so many reasons, including HOPE."
21755,"@Britestoan @werwasundwo @IlhanMN Highly unlikely, because Biden won’t suck up to Putin, or help Netanyahu or further weaponize Saudi Arabia. He will also reignite the Iranian arms treaty and rejoin the Paris Climate agreement."
21756,We call on President @JoeBiden to go beyond recommitting the US to the Paris Climate Agreement. We urge him to deliver on a concrete and ambitious plan to fulfill the United States’ full #FairShare of #ClimateAction. https://t.co/OAwTpovP5h

21758,"@JustinTrudeau @jkenney Please stop spending on fossil fuels - it’s contrary to our responsibilities under the Paris Climate agreement, AND this should teach us that O&amp;G profitability is too dependent on foreign policies. The US can block a pipeline, OPEC can sink prices by ramping up production."
21759,"This is the time for the US to come back. There is so much to do:
1. Rejoin the Paris climate agreement.
2. Rejoin the WHO.
3. Facilitate the distribution of Covid vaccinations.
4. Make masks compulsory.
5. Reinforce the Western alliances &amp; NATO through phone calls."
